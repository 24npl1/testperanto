    "2. What are the weights of the expanded rules?\n",

    "To answer these questions, we associate `$z1` with a distribution called `nn`. In this case, we have specified that the `nn` distribution is a uniform distribution over the integers from 1 to 3, by providing a key called `zdists` associated with a list of distributions. Each distribution in this list corresponds to a z-variable, starting with `$z1`, `$z2`, etc. Thus the indexed rule `$qnc -> (NC nc.$z1)` abbreviates the 3 rules:\n",

    "\n",
    "The weight of each rule is the baseweight of the indexed rule (recall that this defaults to `1.0`) multiplied by the probability of its instantiation of `$z1` according to distribution `nn`. Thus, each rule has the weight `1/3`. Therefore, if we generate sentences from this grammar, we should obtain three different words in roughly equal proportion."
